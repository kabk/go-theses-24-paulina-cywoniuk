<h1 class = "target intro" id="intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>Since I was young I have always been fascinated by good stories.
Every time I was exposed to a game, a movie or any other piece of art
that would tell a story in an entertaining way, I’d remember it and let
it live in my head rent free. Until this day when I see a story that
moves me I keep it in my head, replay it in my memories, I add stuff to
it in my imagination and I relive it over and over, my way. This is an
amazing feeling that entertains me and it is something I want to give to
others as a designer. <mark>What I aspire to analyse in my thesis are
the manifold ways of storytelling in interactive environments while
attempting to comprehend this medium better.</mark></p>
<p>I believe that interactivity adds to every story on another level.
<mark>What do I mean by that? I argue that i</mark>t can engage the
audience emotionally, making them believe that their actions and choices
influence the story itself and thus make them engage with it more or it
can encourage people to explore more freely the possibilities of it, and
more. As a maker my values include providing entertainment to people,
spreading curiosity and telling stories people can relate to, thus those
are the things I’d like to research further on a theoretical level in my
thesis. For me an interactive story is by definition close to a game,
that’s why in majority I will be focusing on games as examples in my
thesis.</p>
<p>I would like to analyse different types of interactive environments
for storytelling as well as the ways to tell a story. My main
inspiration for how I’d analyse the storytelling pieces comes from Jakob
Geller<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, an inspiration of mine. He’s a
writer and a game analyst and the way he describes games reminds me of
how one would analyse a literature piece. He analyses narratives in
video games and compares them to real world examples and how a
particular story is presented in the medium of video games.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I’m a fan of his approach to game
analysis because it’s different from everything I’ve seen so far and I
see him telling his own story through his writing, it is really
engaging. When I looked for people who write about games he stood out to
me since he didn’t focus as much on the mechanics of the games he
described, but instead on the story being told. He says that writing
about games can be boring to analyse every technicality. Instead Jakob
Geller recommends two categories: previews (what this game might be
like) and reviews (what this game is like). As I’m watching his video
essays on YouTube I feel so invested, even when he talks about games
I’ve never seen before. That’s why I’ll try my best to take inspiration
from his way of writing. He has a poetic way to analyse games as a piece
of art in my opinion.</p>
<p>I'll attempt to provide examples of various stories told in specific
interactive environments and I will dig into how those stories benefit
from their medium.</p>

<h2 class="target chapter-1" id="storytelling">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>I see stories in every part of my life. When I walk in the city I see
advertisements with marketing attempting to tell a story of a particular
brand. When I go on social media I see everyday stories of my friends.
Movies I watch, games I play or books I read are all stories - whether
they are fictional or not. Probably most of my knowledge is based on
stories I was told as a kid. “Every culture has its own stories or
narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education,
cultural preservation or instilling moral values.”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Storytelling has evolved over centuries, adapting to different media
and technological advancements. I noticed that In recent years, the
influence of graphic design and game design has given rise to a
fascinating intersection where storytelling takes on new dimensions in
interactive environments.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In this chapter I’ll look into the
essence of storytelling, explore its connection to graphic design and
game design, highlighting its significance, and elucidate how
interactive environments can enhance and enrich the narrative
experience.</p>
<p>At its core, storytelling involves the creation and communication of
a narrative, weaving together characters, settings, and series of events
to evoke an emotional response or convey a message. The beauty of
storytelling lies in its ability to transport audiences to different
worlds, evoke powerful emotions, engage and provoke thought and
introspection. Through storytelling, individuals can explore universal
themes and experiences, confront complex issues, and gain new
perspectives on the world around them. Whether through literature, film,
theatre, oral traditions, or digital media, storytelling has the power
to inspire, educate, and entertain. Traditionally confined to oral
traditions, storytelling has now found a new canvas in the digital
realm, with interactive environments offering an unprecedented platform
for engagement. Users no longer passively consume a narrative but
actively contribute to its unfolding, influencing outcomes and shaping
the story's direction. By giving the audience a choice on how to
progress in the story, or an illusion of one (more about it in Chapter
3) they can be more engaged. This evolution in storytelling aligns
seamlessly with the principles of graphic design and game design,
creating a symbiotic relationship that is integral to the modern
creative landscape. Stories that are presented in different media can
branch into various developments, being interactive mediums like video
games, where choices made by the player can influence the story, or less
interactive, like films or books.</p>
<p>Graphic design, with its emphasis on visual communication, plays an
important role in storytelling. Visual elements, such as typography,
colour schemes, and imagery, contribute to the overall narrative
experience. In a commercial context, storytelling becomes a valuable
strategy for branding and marketing too. Brands leverage interactive
environments to craft compelling narratives that resonate with their
audience, creating memorable and impactful experiences.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> A
well-designed visual language can enhance the emotional impact of a
story or guide the user's attention. Game design, on the other hand,
characterised by its interactive entertainment creates narratives that
are shaped by player choices and actions. The fusion of gameplay
mechanics with storytelling elements results in a unique medium where
users not only experience a story but actively participate in its
construction<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The significance of storytelling in interactive environments extends
beyond entertainment. <mark>Be it civil or of military nature: think of
educational settings, in which i</mark>nteractive storytelling can
facilitate immersive learning experiences, making complex subjects more
accessible and engaging.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>[add Harun Farocki → in the 4th
chapter] Interactive environments provide a canvas for storytellers to
experiment with non-linear narratives, player agency, and emergent
storytelling. The element of interactivity introduces a dynamic
dimension to the narrative, where user choices, exploration, and
interactions shape the unfolding story. This participatory nature not
only enhances engagement but also encourages users to invest emotionally
in the narrative outcomes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of immersive technologies, such as virtual reality
(VR) and augmented reality (AR), elevates the storytelling experience to
new heights. These technologies immerse users in virtual worlds,
blurring the lines between fiction and reality. The spatial and sensory
aspects of VR, for instance, enable users to explore and interact with
the story environment in ways previously unattainable, enhancing the
overall storytelling experience.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge also the risks of the addictive nature of such
immersion. This can be one of the reasons why gaming can become
addictive but also due to reward systems or social elements, which can
lead to excessive gaming behaviour and neglect of other
responsibilities. Additionally, the incorporation of gambling mechanics,
such as loot boxes or in-game currency purchases, in some games can
contribute to addictive behaviours by exploiting psychological triggers
and encouraging repetitive spending in pursuit of rewards. In this
thesis though I will not be focusing on the addictive mechanics of
interactive environments, but on how stories told in those mediums can
be more appealing to the audience.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, stories can be told in different media, orally,
as a written story, a film, (series of) images or something else
entirely. Fairytales can be an example of oral storytelling, especially
those that mean to convey morals in them. In the fairy tale "The
Tortoise and the Hare," the moral emphasises the importance of
perseverance and consistency over arrogance and overconfidence. Despite
the hare's natural speed, the tortoise's steady progress and
determination ultimately lead to victory, teaching the lesson that slow
and steady wins the race.</p>
<p>I personally see a strong connection between storytelling and games
in particular, I believe this medium enriches the possibilities of
engaging in a story. Adding interactivity to it provides additional
entertainment for the audience and provides a new canvas to present the
story on. Interactive environments refer to digital or physical spaces
designed to engage users actively through real-time interactions and
feedback.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Physical interactive environments
can involve interactive installations, such as art exhibits or
educational displays, where users' actions influence the experience or
outcome. In digital contexts, they may include virtual reality
simulations, online gaming platforms, or interactive websites that
respond to user inputs. The goal of interactive environments is to
provide immersive and engaging experiences, promoting user participation
and a sense of involvement in the environment's evolution.</p>
<p>In the next chapter I will describe my experiences with storytelling
in tabletop, card and board games. This particular environment will not
be digital, but nonetheless interactive and engaging.</p>

Chapter 2
<h2 class="target chapter-2" id="tabletop">Chapter 2</h2>
<p><em>When I was 16 I was invited to play Dungeons and Dragons</em>
(D&amp;D) <em>with my friends for the first time. I heard about this
game before, but the only image about it that I had is that it’s a
popular game among “nerds”</em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <em>in the USA. I didn’t
mind playing a nerdy game or being perceived as a “nerd”, I just was
excited to play something with my friends. I was asked to prepare
something beforehand - my own character for the play. I’ve never heard
about any board game before that was necessary to prepare beforehand so
I was a bit surprised.</em></p>
<p><img src="media/image5.png"
style="width:2.69451in;height:3.43121in" /><a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a><img src="media/image2.jpg"
style="width:2.50379in;height:3.27496in" /><a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><em>When I asked my friend for help with filling up the character
sheet, he sent me A WHOLE BOOK as an instruction. Upon further research
I found that it’s 46 books</em><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <em>that goes into
making this game whole! No wonder people say it’s a game for nerds, that
sure is a lot of lore to read and rules to understand…</em></p>
<p>In Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who
explore fantasy worlds together as they embark on epic quests and level
up in experience. The “Dungeon Master” (DM) is the game's referee and
storyteller. At its heart, D&amp;D is a game that focuses on
storytelling. The dice just help you along.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
Everything is your decision, from what you look like, to how you act, to
what happens next. The collective creativity in your D&amp;D game builds
stories that you’ll tell again and again—ranging from the stuff of
legend to absurd incidents that’ll make campaign members laugh. D&amp;D
provides a platform for interactive storytelling, where players actively
engage with the narrative through role-playing and improvisation. By
assuming the roles of fictional characters, players immerse themselves
in the story world, blurring the lines between fiction and reality. I
think this interactive element heightens player immersion and emotional
investment in the narrative, making the storytelling experience more
compelling and memorable.</p>
<p><em>I was reassured though that I need to know only a few chapters
from one book to start playing. So I got into it and as I was reading
what options I’m choosing from I got more and more excited. First, I
went with choosing the race of my character. In the basic Player’s
Handbook there are 9 races to choose from - Dwarf, Elf, Hafling, Human,
Dragonborn, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc and Tiefling. I went for the
dragonborn, because dragons are cool and I wanted to play as a half
dragon. Then, I needed to choose my class and I went with a Warlock
because I liked the idea of performing magic spells. I was choosing from
those twelve:</em> <em>Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk,
Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock and Wizard.</em></p>
<p><em>And there I was! A warlock half-dragon named Max - my own
character starting an adventure with my friends!</em></p>
<p>When someone plays a <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> session for the
first time it can be a quite awkward experience. Usually a group of
players sit by the table, all of them with character sheets in their
hands, a bunch of weird dice and that’s it. No board game, no cards, no
controller, just an empty table and their imagination. The main
storyteller - a DM, starts by setting up the scenery of the game. It can
be anything, as long as it’s a fantasy setting. They do it by simply
describing it to the players.</p>
<p><em>“A gentle breeze moves your hair slightly as you stick your head
out of the caravan. The heat of the desert makes you sweat even more but
your curiosity wins. You’ve been travelling for a few days now and you
can finally see your destination - the city of Johnturn. You smile from
excitement as huge city gates get closer and closer. You turn back
inside to tell that to your crew mates (...) ”</em></p>
<p>This could be the beginning of a new D&amp;D game. It took me about 5
minutes to write it from the top of my head and I don’t say it to flex,
but to say it’s easy to start playing as long as there’s an idea for a
story. Coming up with a story in D&amp;D can be pretty straightforward
given the flexibility and creativity in storytelling and gameplay. The
rules are designed to be adaptable, which makes it easier for the DM to
create and adapt content on the fly, without being bound by rigid rules
or predefined outcomes. Moreover, D&amp;D is a collaborative
storytelling experience, so both the DM and players contribute to the
narrative. This shared responsibility for storytelling alleviates some
of the pressure on the DM to single-handedly create and manage the
entire campaign. Players can also contribute their own ideas,
backstories, and character motivations, enriching the overall
storytelling experience.</p>
<p>Tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) such as D&amp;D operate on the
fundamental principles of player agency and collaboration. Unlike
traditional storytelling mediums where the audience passively consumes a
predetermined narrative, D&amp;D players actively participate in shaping
the story through their decisions and actions. Story that the DM comes
up with rarely develops according to plan because of individual player’s
decisions shaping the story as it develops. The Dungeon Master serves as
both storyteller and facilitator, adapting the narrative in response to
player choices, thereby creating a dynamic and personalised storytelling
experience.</p>
<p>Story told in a D&amp;D session can be enriched thanks to team work
of the players, their collaboration and collective problem-solving. This
cooperative element not only strengthens their social bonds, but also
helps the storytelling process by incorporating diverse perspectives and
ideas. In the context of game theory, collaboration in D&amp;D can be
likened to cooperative gameplay strategies<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>,
where players work together to achieve a common goal despite potential
conflicts of interest. This collaborative dynamic adds depth and
complexity to the narrative itself.</p>
<p>At its core, D&amp;D is about having fun and telling engaging stories
with friends. While there are rules and mechanics to learn and master,
the primary goal of a D&amp;D campaign is to create memorable
experiences and enjoy shared adventures with fellow players. This focus
on fun and camaraderie can make running a D&amp;D campaign feel less
daunting and more enjoyable for DMs and players alike. All those things
make stories told in the medium of this tabletop role playing game more
engaging to experience. There are no stories that are passively consumed
by the players since they build the story together and each experience
matters for the whole story.</p>

<h2 class="target chapter-3" id="videogames">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Life is strange, Stanley Parable, ICO</p>
<p>Story presented in the medium of a video game can cause emotional
connection between players and the medium.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
One reason for creating the emotional involvement in the game can be the
power of choice given for the player. Unlike passive forms of
storytelling, such as books or movies, video games actively involve
players in the narrative. Through gameplay mechanics, players make
decisions that impact the story's progression, character development,
and outcomes. Whether this power is actually given to them or it is an
illusion of choice.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> This interactive engagement invests
players emotionally in the narrative, as they feel personally
responsible for the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>When thinking about a game that gave me such choices, what comes to
my mind is <em>Life is Strange</em>, a game made by Don’tNod in 2015.
Story is about a girl, Max, who suddenly gets power to reverse time
after having a vision of a tornado destroying the city she studies in.
Us, as players, we impersonate her character and are responsible for the
choices she makes. Whole game is choice based, dialogue exchanges
feature branching options<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> in conversations and
whatever dialog options we choose we will be faced with either short or
long term consequences. As the story progresses we reunite with our
childhood friend, Cloe, learn about a missing person, Rachel and go look
for her as we interact with other non-playable characters.</p>
<p><img src="media/image4.jpg"
style="width:5.61979in;height:3.22065in" /></p>
<p>One of the most moving stories from this game that stuck with me
until today is the story of Kate. The fellow student of Max who is being
bullied for a viral video depicting her kissing several students at a
party, what pushes her to commit suicide by jumping off the roof. Max
manages to rewind time and reach the roof, giving her the opportunity to
talk Kate down. Depending on the player's dialogue choices, Max can
either save Kate, or fail to convince her to not jump. I remember when I
was playing it the pressure of being responsible for someone’s life.
Obviously enough I know it is a fictional character but I wanted to save
her so badly I stopped playing for a moment and I went on the Internet
to look for correct dialoge options how to talk Kate out from the
suicide.</p>
<p>Games were not made in the vacuum - while analysing them we need to
remember what they represent. They can explore complex themes and
narratives that resonate with players on a deeper level. From exploring
existential questions to delving into the human condition, video game
stories can evoke a wide range of emotions, including joy, sadness,
fear, and empathy. By engaging players intellectually and emotionally,
video games create lasting emotional connections that transcend the
boundaries of the medium.</p>
<p>In 2004 Peter Eliot wrote a hundred page essay<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
about <em>ICO</em><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, a game released in 2001 by Japan
Studio and Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the
PlayStation 2. This essay is not purely about gameplay but about his
feelings when he played this game. It follows the emotional involvement
of the player as he progresses in the game plot. The actual storyline is
a straightforward fairy tale about a prince who is saving a princess
from a castle. The reason why he got so emotionally connected to the
story is because of his interpretation of this game as a piece or art.
The way he interprets art is a conversation between the piece and his
own lived experience.</p>
<p>Same as I was connected emotionally with the story from Life is
Strange since it reminded me about those situations in my personal life
when I actually was talking my best friend out the suicide attempt.</p>
<p><img src="media/image3.png"
style="width:2.68567in;height:2.68121in" /></p>
<p>Story in <em>Life is Strange</em> ends in the tornado coming to the
city and a player has to make a choice for Max - should we rewind time
and save the city from destruction, or stay with our lover (Cloe) in the
current time. Those two choices are hard to digest, after all, we are
either choosing personal happiness or the well -being of the whole
community. There is, though, one set of choices that can be made through
the game, that gives us options at the end to both save the city and
stay with Cloe. In this story choices that players make along the way
strongly influence the story presented in this game both long and short
term. Sometimes though, there are stories presented in games that give
the audience an illusion of choice in the short term, that doesn’t
influence the story as a whole in the end. One of the games like that is
the <em>Stanley Parable</em> designed and written by Davey Wreden and
William Pugh in 2013.</p>
<p>In the game, the player plays as a silent protagonist named Stanley
alongside narration done by the British actor Kevan Brighting. As the
story progresses, the player is confronted with various branching paths.
Players have the option to defy the narrator's instructions, leading to
these acts of rebellion becoming part of the evolving story or listen to
him and watch the story develop as it “should”. Depending on the choices
made, the player will encounter different endings before the game resets
to the beginning.</p>
<p><img src="media/image1.jpg"
style="width:3.71354in;height:2.08776in" /></p>
<p>In this example the player's choices matter only for the experience
of the story temporarily, to later be disregarded and come back to the
default start. If power of choice is not dominant in this video game
then what could be making this story so interesting to the players? Most
likely it is the overall concept of the player dictating their own role
inside the game. Games often feature protagonists with whom players can
identify, even if they are as abstract as “the Stanley”. By assuming the
role of these characters, players develop a sense of connection and
attachment, experiencing the story through their eyes. Especially
rebellion from the set path for such a character can be an appealing
thing to motivate the audience to engage in this story.</p>
<p>[summary?]</p>

<h2 class="target chapter-4" id="immersiveprojects">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>Immersive mediums such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality
(AR) are a relatively modern technology (circa 1980s) and still have
much to discover. That’s why it is particularly interesting to
investigate how stories benefit from being presented in one of them. Not
so long ago I was visiting the International Documentary Film Festival
Amsterdam (IDFA) 2023 festival, where I spent the most of my time in the
IDFA Lab, where they were presenting immersive projects. I’ve seen many
360° films there, some video games and a few AR based projects. One of
them stood out to me in particular - <em>Emperor</em> done by Marion
Burger and Ilan Cohen in 2023. The reason why it was different from
other projects is that it was more interactive than other VR
projects.</p>
<p><em>When I put on the VR goggles I was dragged into a black and white
world that looked like a hand drawn illustration. A female voice started
speaking directly to me, telling me a story of how hard it was for her
to witness her father’s stroke on one of the hot summer days in France.
The way she was sharing her experience with me made me feel empathetic
to her situation and more interested in the story overall. Further into
the story I was put in the position of the father himself. She was
asking me to write down what time it was on a piece of paper. I took my
controller that I was holding in my right hand and to my surprise I
could see a virtual hand following my movements. With my digital hand
I’ve picked up a pen and tried to write down “14:35”. The moment I did
it, numbers on the paper changed into some scribbles. My “daughter”
sighed and asked me to try again. At that moment I felt the frustration
of the father from this story, I couldn’t communicate with people around
me. Any attempt that I’ve made was met with an obstacle. I could for
that brief moment experience what people with aphasia</em><a
href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <em>might be experiencing on a
daily basis.</em></p>
<p>Through realistic visuals, spatial audio, and interactive elements,
VR can create powerful emotional connections with characters and story
events, making the storytelling experience more impactful and memorable.
Compared to films, there is no director that tells the audience what
shot of the story to watch, when we put on VR goggles suddenly we are
the director and we control what angle we want to see. Having the power
over it may make his medium more appealing to the audience and thus make
them more engaged with the story presented. For those who have not
experienced what is presented in the immersive stories, VR simulations
can provide a glimpse into the reality of it. By immersing viewers in
the perspectives of people from different cultures, with illnesses, or
even war survivors, VR fosters empathy and understanding, influencing
the way their stories are received and interpreted by others. Viewers
may develop a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the story they
experience.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned before in this thesis how the audience engages with
the stories in interactive environments via entertainment. However,
there are stories told in those mediums that are far from entertaining
and yet they still draw in. What I mean by that is an example of a
virtual reality (VR) project done by Haryn Farocki titled “Serious Games
III: Immersion” in 2009-2010. This particular project tells a moving
story of soldiers who have been sent to the war in Afghanistan and now
are suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Using VR
goggles patients are transported to the virtual recreation of the war
they’ve experienced and via exposure therapy they hope to get better.
Farocki presents footage of a role-playing exercise in which military
psychologists demonstrate how to use the PTSD program on their
colleagues, who describe traumatic wartime experiences. The audience of
this project is faced with traumatic stories of the war survivors and
looks at how those soldiers relive their experiences in VR goggles.</p>
<p>VR provides an immersive environment that can evoke strong emotional
responses from users by engaging most of the senses. War survivors
experiencing VR simulations of combat scenarios may feel as though they
are reliving traumatic events, leading to more vivid and detailed
storytelling. The heightened sense of presence in VR can make the
stories told by these individuals feel more immediate and impactful.
Moreover, while putting on the VR goggles one is cut out from the onsite
world, experiencing only this one thing at the time individually. VR can
create a safe and controlled space for war survivors to confront and
process their traumatic experiences. In this supportive environment,
individuals may feel more comfortable opening up and sharing their
stories. The sense of anonymity and detachment afforded by VR can also
reduce feelings of shame or embarrassment, allowing survivors to speak
more freely about their experiences.</p>
<p>Overall, the use of VR in therapy for war survivors not only
facilitates the treatment of PTSD but also influences the way their
stories are told and understood. By providing an immersive and safe
space for expression, fostering empathy and understanding, and enhancing
memory retrieval, VR plays a transformative role in shaping the
narratives of those who have lived through war.</p>
<p>Choosing VR as a medium for the storytelling can help the story
itself by making the audience more engaged in it. [finish up this

<h2 class="target conclusion" id ="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the exploration of storytelling in interactive
environments reveals a dynamic and multifaceted landscape where
narratives are crafted, experienced, and shared in novel ways. From
traditional mediums like oral storytelling, literature and film to
modern platforms such as video games and virtual reality, storytelling
continues to evolve, adapting to new technologies and engaging audiences
in immersive experiences. The beauty of storytelling lies in its ability
to transport audiences to different worlds, evoke powerful emotions, and
provoke thought and introspection.</p>
<p>In this thesis, I have delved into various forms of interactive
storytelling, examining their significance and impact on audience
engagement. From tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons
to video games like Life is Strange and The Stanley Parable, we have
witnessed how interactivity enhances the narrative experience, allowing
players to actively shape the story through their decisions and actions.
In these environments, storytelling becomes a collaborative endeavour,
with both creators and players contributing to the unfolding
narrative.</p>
<p>Moreover, the emergence of immersive technologies such as virtual
reality has opened up new possibilities for storytelling, allowing users
to step into virtual worlds and experience narratives in unprecedented
ways. Through realistic visuals, spatial audio, and interactive
elements, VR creates powerful emotional connections with characters and
story events, fostering empathy and understanding. Projects like
"Serious Games III: Immersion" by Harun Farocki demonstrate how VR can
be used not only for entertainment but also for therapeutic purposes,
facilitating the treatment of PTSD and shaping the narratives of war
survivors.</p>
<p>In this ever-evolving landscape of interactive storytelling, the role
of the storyteller remains crucial. Whether it's a Dungeon Master
guiding players through a D&amp;D campaign, a game developer crafting
branching narratives in a video game, or an artist creating immersive
experiences in virtual reality, storytellers have the power to captivate
audiences, provoke emotions, and spark imagination. By harnessing the
principles of game theory and storytelling, creators can create
compelling narratives that resonate with audiences on a deeper
level.</p>
<p>In conclusion, storytelling in interactive environments represents a
convergence of creativity, technology, and human experience, offering
endless opportunities for exploration and discovery. Whether it's
through a game, a virtual reality experience, or a collaborative
storytelling session, the power of storytelling transcends boundaries,
connecting people across cultures, languages, and backgrounds. As we
navigate this ever-changing landscape, let us continue to embrace the
magic of storytelling and harness its transformative potential for the
benefit of all.</p>
