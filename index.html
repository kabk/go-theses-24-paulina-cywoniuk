<p>This thesis explores the influence of interactive environments on
storytelling. It will dive into the evolution of storytelling in the
digital age and investigate how various games and immersive projects can
serve as a catalyst for engaging narrative experiences. Additionally,
this thesis examines case studies of successful interactive storytelling
projects, highlighting the role of interactivity in shaping the user's
journey and fostering a more profound connection between the audience
and the narrative. Ultimately, this investigation contributes to the
understanding of the dynamic role game design plays in pushing the
boundaries of narrative communication in the digital era and how
storytelling benefits from the interactive mediums.</p>

<h2 class = "target intro" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since I have been young I have always been fascinated by good
stories. Every time I was exposed to a game, a movie or any other piece
of art that would tell a story in an entertaining way, I’d remember it
and let it live in my mind rent free. Until this day when I see a story
that moves me, I keep it in my head, replay it in my memories, I add
stuff to it in my imagination and I relive it over and over, my way.
This is an amazing feeling that entertains me and it is something I want
to give others as a designer. What I aspire to analyse in my
thesis are the manifold ways of storytelling in interactive environments
while attempting to comprehend this medium better.</p>
<p>I believe that interactivity adds to every story on another level.
What do I mean by that? I argue that it can engage the
audience emotionally, making them believe that their actions and choices
influence the story itself. This makes them engage with it more or it
can encourage people to explore more freely the possibilities of it, and
more. As a maker my values include providing entertainment to people,
spreading curiosity and telling stories people can relate to, thus those
are the things I’d like to research further on a theoretical level in my
thesis. For me an interactive story is by definition close to a game,
that’s why in majority I will be focusing on games as examples in my
thesis.</p>
<p>I would like to analyse different types of interactive environments
for storytelling as well as the ways to tell a story. My main
inspiration for how I’d analyse the storytelling pieces comes from Jakob
Geller<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Contributors to Wikitubia. “Jacob Geller.” Fandom, Inc., https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob_Geller.<br/><br />
</span></span>
. He’s a writer and a game analyst
and the way he describes games reminds me of how one would analyse a
literature piece. He analyses narratives in video games and compares
them to real world examples and how a particular story is presented in
the medium of video games.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Geller, Jacob. “Staring into the Sun, and Other Ways of Capturing Transcendence.” YouTube, Video, 7 Aug. 2023, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSbUPaLTTUg.
	<br/><br /></span></span> I’m a fan of his
approach to game analysis because it’s different from everything I’ve
seen so far and I see him telling his own story through his writing, it
is really engaging. When I looked for people who write about games he
stood out to me since he didn’t focus as much on the mechanics of the
games he described, but instead on the story being told. He says that in
writing about games it can be boring to analyse every technicality.
Instead Jakob Geller recommends two categories: previews (what this game
might be like) and reviews (what this game is like). As I’m watching his
video essays on YouTube I feel so invested, even when he talks about
games that I have never seen before. That’s why I will try my best to
take inspiration from his way of writing. He has a poetic way to analyse
games as a piece of art in my opinion.</p>
<p>I'll attempt to provide examples of various stories told in specific
interactive environments and I will dig into how those stories benefit
from their medium.</p>

<h2 class="target chapter-1" id="storytelling">Storytelling</h2>
<p>I see stories in every part of my life. When I walk in the city I see
advertisements with marketing attempting to tell a story of a particular
brand. When I go on social media I see everyday stories of my friends.
Movies I watch, games I play or books I read are all stories - whether
they are fictional or not. Probably most of my knowledge is based on
stories I was told as a kid. “Every culture has its own stories or
narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education,
cultural preservation or instilling moral values.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">“Storytelling.” Wikipedia, 24 Feb. 2024, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling.
	<br/><br /></span></span></p>
<p>Storytelling has evolved over centuries, adapting to different media
and technological advancements. I noticed that in recent years, the
influence of graphic design and game design has given rise to a
fascinating intersection where storytelling takes on new dimensions in
interactive environments.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The Simple Essence of Great Storytelling. https://www.faisaljamshaid.com/blog/the-simple-essence-of-great-storytelling.
	<br/><br /></span></span> In this chapter I’ll look into the
essence of storytelling, explore its connection to graphic design and
game design, highlighting its significance, and elucidate how
interactive environments can enhance and enrich the narrative
experience.</p>
<p>At its core, storytelling involves the creation and communication of
a narrative, weaving together characters, settings, and series of events
to evoke an emotional response or convey a message. The beauty of
storytelling lies in its ability to transport audiences to different
worlds, evoke powerful emotions, engage and provoke thought and
introspection. Through storytelling, individuals can explore universal
themes and experiences, confront complex issues, and gain new
perspectives on the world around them. Whether through literature, film,
theatre, oral traditions, or digital media, storytelling has the power
to inspire, educate, and entertain.</p>
<p>Traditionally confined to oral traditions, storytelling has now found
a new canvas in the digital realm, with interactive environments
offering an unprecedented platform for engagement. Users no longer
passively consume a narrative but actively contribute to its unfolding,
influencing outcomes and shaping the story's direction. By giving the
audience a choice on how to progress in the story, or an illusion of one
(more about it in Chapter 3) they can be more engaged. Stories that are
presented in different media can branch into various developments, being
interactive mediums like video games, where choices made by the player
can influence the story, or less interactive, like films or books.</p>
<p>Graphic design, with its emphasis on visual communication, plays an
important role in storytelling. Visual elements, such as typography,
colour schemes, and imagery, contribute to the overall narrative
experience. In a commercial context, storytelling becomes a valuable
strategy for branding and marketing too. Brands leverage interactive
environments to craft compelling narratives that resonate with their
audience, creating memorable and impactful experiences.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Decker, Allie. “The Ultimate Guide to Storytelling.” HubSpot, 05 Nov. 2023, https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/storytelling.
	<br/><br /></span></span> A
well-designed visual language can enhance the emotional impact of a
story or guide the user's attention. Game design, on the other hand,
characterised by its interactive entertainment creates narratives that
are shaped by player choices and actions. The fusion of gameplay
mechanics with storytelling elements results in a unique medium where
users not only experience a story but actively participate in its
construction<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Alismail, Halah Ahmed. “Integrate Digital Storytelling in Education.” Integrate Digital Storytelling in Education, 2015, https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1082416.pdf.
	<br/><br /></span></span>.</p>
<p>The significance of storytelling in interactive environments extends
beyond entertainment. Be it of civil or of military nature: think
of educational settings, in which interactive storytelling can
facilitate immersive learning experiences, making complex subjects more
accessible and engaging.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Skolnick, Evan. Video Game Storytelling: What Every Developer Needs to Know about Narrative Techniques. CRC Press, 2014.
	<br/><br /></span></span> Interactive environments provide a
canvas for storytellers to experiment with non-linear narratives, player
agency, and emergent storytelling. The element of interactivity
introduces a dynamic dimension to the narrative, where user choices,
exploration, and interactions shape the unfolding story. This
participatory nature not only enhances engagement but also encourages
users to invest emotionally in the narrative outcomes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of immersive technologies, such as virtual reality
(VR) and augmented reality (AR), elevates the storytelling experience to
new heights. These technologies immerse users in virtual worlds,
blurring the lines between fiction and reality. The spatial and sensory
aspects of VR, for instance, enable users to explore and interact with
the story environment in ways previously unattainable, enhancing the
overall storytelling experience.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge also the risks of the addictive nature of such
immersion.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Dwivedi, Yogesh K., et al. “Metaverse beyond the Hype: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Emerging Challenges, Opportunities, and Agenda for Research, Practice and Policy.” International Journal of Information Management, vol. 66, Oct. 2022, p. 102542, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102542.
	<br/><br /></span></span> This can be one of the reasons why
gaming can become addictive but also due to reward systems or social
elements, which can lead to excessive gaming behaviour and neglect of
other responsibilities. Additionally, the incorporation of gambling
mechanics, such as loot boxes or in-game currency purchases, in some
games can contribute to addictive behaviours by exploiting psychological
triggers and encouraging repetitive spending in pursuit of rewards. In
this thesis though I will not be focusing on the addictive mechanics of
interactive environments, but on how stories told in those mediums can
be more appealing to the audience.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, stories can be told in different media, orally,
as a written story, a film, as a (series of) images or something else
entirely. Fairytales can be an example of both written and oral
storytelling, especially those that mean to convey morals in them. In
the fairy tale "The Tortoise and the Hare," the moral emphasises the
importance of perseverance and consistency over arrogance and
overconfidence. Despite the hare's natural speed, the tortoise's steady
progress and determination ultimately lead to victory, teaching the
lesson that slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<p>I personally see a strong connection between storytelling and games
in particular, I believe this medium enriches the possibilities of
engaging in a story. Adding interactivity to it provides additional
entertainment for the audience and provides a new canvas to present the
story on. Interactive environments refer to digital or physical spaces
designed to engage users actively through real-time interactions and
feedback.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Rachael. “What Is The Difference Between Immersive And Interactive - Draw & Code.” Draw & Code - VR, AR & Immersive Tech, https://drawandcode.com/learning-zone/what-is-the-difference-between-immersive-and-interactive/.
	<br/><br /></span></span> Physical interactive environments
can involve interactive installations, such as art exhibits or
educational displays, where users' actions influence the experience or
outcome. In digital contexts, they may include virtual reality
simulations, online gaming platforms, or interactive websites that
respond to user inputs. For example the website on which this thesis is
published, I use shapes in the background to create a playful and
interactive environment.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">https://github.com/kabk/go-theses-24-paulina-cywoniuk
	<br/><br /></span></span></p>
<p>In the next chapter I will describe my experiences with storytelling
in tabletop, card and board games. Tabletop games are various types of
games that are played on the table. This particular environment will not
be digital, but nonetheless interactive and engaging.</p>

<h2 class="target chapter-2" id="tabletop">Tabletop</h2>
<p><em>When I was 16 I was invited to play Dungeons and Dragons</em>
	(D&amp;D) <em>with my friends for the first time. I heard about this
	game before, but the only image about it that I had is that it’s a
	popular game among “nerds”</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Dictionary, Cambridge. “Nerd.” English Meaning - Cambridge Dictionary, https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nerd.
		<br/><br /></span></span></p><em>. I didn’t mind
	playing a nerdy game or being perceived as a “nerd”, I just was excited
	to play something with my friends. I was asked to prepare something
	beforehand - my own character for the play. I’ve never heard about any
	board game before that was necessary to prepare beforehand so I was a
	bit surprised.</em></p>

		<br/><br /></span></span> <em>that goes into
	making this game whole! No wonder people say it’s a game for nerds, that
	sure is a lot of lore to read and rules to understand…</em></p>
	<p>In Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who
	explore fantasy worlds together as they embark on epic quests and level
	up in experience. The “Dungeon Master” (DM) is the game's referee and
	storyteller. At its heart, D&amp;D is a game that focuses on
	storytelling. Everything is your decision, from what you look like, to
	how you act, to what happens next. The collective creativity in your
	D&amp;D game builds stories that you’ll tell again and again—ranging
	from the stuff of legend to absurd incidents that’ll make campaign
	members laugh. D&amp;D provides a platform for interactive storytelling,
	where players actively engage with the narrative through role-playing
	and improvisation. By assuming the roles of fictional characters,
	players immerse themselves in the story world, blurring the lines
	between fiction and reality. I think this interactive element heightens
	player immersion and emotional investment in the narrative, making the
	storytelling experience more compelling and memorable.</p>
	<p><em>I was reassured though that I need to know only a few chapters
	from one book to start playing. So I got into it and as I was reading
	what options I’m choosing from I got more and more excited. First, I
	went with choosing the race of my character. In the basic Player’s
	Handbook there are 9 races to choose from - Dwarf, Elf, Hafling, Human,
	Dragonborn, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc and Tiefling. I went for the
	dragonborn, because dragons are cool and I wanted to play as a half
	dragon. Then, I needed to choose my class and I went with a Warlock
	because I liked the idea of performing magic spells. I was choosing from
	those twelve:</em> <em>Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk,
	Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock and Wizard.</em></p>
	<p><em>And there I was! A warlock half-dragon named Max - my own
	character starting an adventure with my friends!</em></p>
	<p>When someone plays a <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> session for the
	first time it can be a quite awkward experience. Usually a group of
	players sit by the table, all of them with character sheets in their
	hands, a bunch of weird dice and that’s it. No board game, no cards, no
	controller, just an empty table and their imagination. The main
	storyteller - a DM, starts by setting up the scenery of the game. It can
	be anything, as long as it’s a fantasy setting (or not even!). They do
	it by simply describing it to the players.</p>
	<p><em>“A gentle breeze moves your hair slightly as you stick your head
	out of the caravan. The heat of the desert makes you sweat even more but
	your curiosity wins. You’ve been travelling for a few days now and you
	can finally see your destination - the city of Johnturn. You smile from
	excitement as huge city gates get closer and closer. You turn back
	inside to tell that to your crew mates (...) ”</em></p>
	<p>This could be the beginning of a new D&amp;D game. Coming up with a
	story in D&amp;D can be pretty straightforward given the flexibility and
	creativity in storytelling and gameplay. The rules are designed to be
	adaptable, which makes it easier for the DM to create and adapt content
	on the fly, without being bound by rigid rules or predefined outcomes.
	Moreover, D&amp;D is a collaborative storytelling experience, so both
	the DM and players contribute to the narrative. This shared
	responsibility for storytelling alleviates some of the pressure on the
	DM to single-handedly create and manage the entire campaign. Players can
	also contribute their own ideas, backstories, and character motivations,
	enriching the overall storytelling experience.</p>
	<p>Tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) such as D&amp;D operate on the
	fundamental principles of player agency and collaboration. Unlike
	traditional storytelling mediums where the audience passively consumes a
	predetermined narrative, D&amp;D players actively participate in shaping
	the story through their decisions and actions. The story that the DM
	comes up with rarely develops according to plan because of the
	individual player’s decisions shaping the story as it develops. The
	Dungeon Master serves as both storyteller and facilitator, adapting the
	narrative in response to player choices, thereby creating a dynamic and
	personalised storytelling experience.</p>
	<p>Stories told in a D&amp;D session can be enriched by the team work of
	the players, their collaboration and collective problem-solving. This
	cooperative element not only strengthens their social bonds, but also
	helps the storytelling process by incorporating diverse perspectives and
	ideas. In the context of game theory, collaboration in D&amp;D can be
	likened to cooperative gameplay strategies<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"> Barkley, Andrew. “Chapter 6. Game Theory.” New Prairie Press, 31 July 2019, https://kstatelibraries.pressbooks.pub/economicsoffoodandag/chapter/__unknown__-6/.
		<br/><br /></span></span>,
	where players work together to achieve a common goal despite potential
	conflicts of interest (such as who is the first to collect all the shiny
	new loot or kill more enemies). This collaborative dynamic adds depth
	and complexity to the narrative itself.</p>
	<p>At its core, D&amp;D is about having fun and telling engaging stories
	with friends. While there are rules and mechanics to learn and master,
	the primary goal of a D&amp;D campaign is to create memorable
	experiences and enjoy shared adventures with fellow players. This focus
	on fun and camaraderie can make running a D&amp;D campaign feel less
	daunting and more enjoyable for DMs and players alike. All those things
	make stories told in the medium of this tabletop role playing game more
	engaging to experience. There are no stories that are passively consumed
	by the players since they build the story together and each experience
	matters for the whole story.</p>

	<h2 class="target chapter-3" id="videogames">Video Games</h2>
	<p>A story presented in the medium of a video game can cause emotional
	connection between players and the medium.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"> Said by Jakob Geller 
		<br/><br /></span></span>
	One reason for creating emotional involvement in the game can be the
	power of choice given to the player. Unlike passive forms of
	storytelling, such as books or movies, video games actively involve
	players in the narrative. Through gameplay mechanics, players make
	decisions that impact the story's progression, character development,
	and outcomes. Whether this power is actually given to them or it is an
	illusion of choice.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"> Cuncic, Arlin. “What Is the Illusion of Choice?” Verywell Mind, 28 Apr. 2022, https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-illusion-of-choice-5224973.
		<br/><br /></span></span> This interactive engagement invests
	players emotionally in the narrative, as they feel personally
	responsible for the consequences of their actions.</p>
	<p>When thinking about a game that gave me such choices, what comes to
	my mind is <em>Life is Strange</em>, a game made by Don’t Nod in 2015.
	The story is about a girl, Max, who suddenly gets power to reverse time
	after having a vision of a tornado destroying the city she studies in.
	Us, as players, we impersonate her character and are responsible for the
	choices she makes. Whole game is choice based, dialogue has branching
	options<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"> Contributors to Wikimedia projects. “Dialogue Tree.” Wikipedia, 30 Jan. 2024, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_tree.
		<br/><br /></span></span> in conversations and whatever
	dialog options we choose, we will be faced with either short or long
	term consequences. As the story progresses we reunite with our childhood
	friend, Cloe, learn about a missing person, Rachel, and go look for her
	as we interact with other non-playable characters.</p>
	<p><img src="assets/images/difference lis.jpg"
	style="width:5.61979in;height:3.22065in" /></p>
	<p>One of the most moving stories from this game that stuck with me is
	the story of Kate. The fellow student of Max who is being bullied for a
	viral video depicting her kissing several students at a part. The
	harrasment pushes her to commit suicide by jumping off the roof. Max
	manages to rewind time and reach the roof, giving her the opportunity to
	talk Kate down. Depending on the player's dialogue choices, Max can
	either save Kate, or fail to convince her to not jump. I remember it
	clearly when I was playing it, the pressure of being responsible for
	someone’s life. Obviously enough, I know it is a fictional character but
	I wanted to save her so badly I stopped playing for a moment and I went
	on the Internet to look for the correct dialogue options that could talk
	Kate out from committing suicide.</p>
	<p>Games were not made in a vacuum - while analysing them we need to
	remember what they represent. And during what socio-economic and
	political climate and context they are created. They can explore
	complex themes and narratives that resonate with players on a deeper
	level. From exploring existential questions to delving into the human
	condition, video game stories can evoke a wide range of emotions,
	including joy, sadness, fear, and empathy. By engaging players
	intellectually and emotionally, video games create lasting emotional
	connections that transcend the boundaries of the medium.</p>

	Studio and Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the
	PlayStation 2. This essay is not purely about gameplay but about his
	feelings when he played this game. It follows the emotional involvement
	of the player as he progresses in the game plot. The actual storyline is
	a straightforward fairy tale about a prince who is saving a princess
	from a castle. The reason why he got so emotionally connected to the
	story is because of his interpretation of this game as a piece of art.
	The way he interprets art is a conversation between the piece and his

	my best friend out of a suicide attempt.</p>
	<p><img src="assets/images/different ico.png"
	style="width:2.68567in;height:2.68121in" /></p>
	<p>The story in <em>Life is Strange</em> ends in a tornado coming to the
	city and a player has to make a choice for Max - should we rewind time
	and save the city from destruction, or stay with our lover (Cloe) in the
	current time. Those two choices are hard to digest; after all, we are
	either choosing personal happiness or the well-being of the whole
	community. There is, though, one set of choices that can be made through
	the game, that gives us options at the end to both save the city and
	stay with Cloe.</p>
	<p>In this story, choices that players make along the way strongly
	influence the story presented in this game both long and short term.</p>
	<p>Sometimes though, there are stories presented in games that give the
	audience an illusion of choice in the short term, that doesn’t influence
	the story as a whole in the end. One of the games like that is the
	<em>Stanley Parable</em> designed and written by Davey Wreden and
	William Pugh in 2013.</p>
	<p>In the game, the player plays as a silent protagonist named Stanley
	alongside narration done by Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses,
	the player is confronted with various branching paths. Players have the
	option to defy the narrator's instructions, leading to these acts of
	rebellion becoming part of the evolving story or listen to him and watch
	the story develop as it “should”. Depending on the choices made, the
	player will encounter different endings before the game resets to the
	beginning.</p>
	<p><img src="assets/images/different stanley.jpg" style="width:220px;height:220px"
	 /></p>
	<p>In this example the player's choices matter only for the experience
	of the story temporarily, to later be disregarded and come back to the
	default start. If power of choice is not dominant in this video game
	then what could be making this story so interesting to the players? Most
	likely it is the overall concept of the player dictating their own role
	inside the game. Games often feature protagonists with whom players can
	identify, even if they are as abstract as “the Stanley”. By assuming the
	role of these characters, players develop a sense of connection and
	attachment, experiencing the story through their eyes. Especially
	rebellion from the set path for such a character can be an appealing
	thing to motivate the audience to engage in this story.</p>
	<p>Overall, storytelling benefits from the medium of video games by
	giving the audience an idea of having the power of choice. We can’t
	forget emotional involvement by giving players relatable characters to
	play as, or creating the engaging settings for the story itself. Video
	games provide strong immersion in the story, but the medium I’ll be
	discussing in the next chapter is even better for it.</p>

<h2 class="target chapter-4" id="immersiveprojects">Immersive Projects</h2>
<p>Immersive mediums such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality
(AR) are a relatively modern technology developed in the 1980s. There is
still much to be developed and to be discovered. That’s why it is
particularly interesting to investigate how stories benefit from being
presented in one of them. Not so long ago, I was visiting the
International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) 2023 festival,
where I spent most of my time in the IDFA Lab, where they were
presenting immersive projects. I’ve seen many 360° films there, some
video games and a few AR based projects. One of them stood out to me in
particular - <em>Emperor</em> done by Marion Burger and Ilan Cohen in
2023<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"> Burger, Marion, and Ilan Cohen. Emperor. VR, 2023, https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/49252b3a-45fb-497f-a95d-9d9ba05ec81e/emperor/. IDFA Lab, Amsterdam.
	<br/><br /></span></span>. The reason why it was different
from other projects is that it was more interactive than other VR
projects.</p>
<p><em>When I put on the VR goggles I was dragged into a black and white
world that looked like a hand drawn illustration. A female voice started
speaking directly to me, telling me a story of how hard it was for her
to witness her father’s stroke on one of the hot summer days in France.
The way she was sharing her experience with me made me feel empathetic
to her situation and more interested in the story overall. Further into
the story I was put in the position of the father himself. She was
asking me to write down what time it was on a piece of paper. I took my
controller that I was holding in my right hand and to my surprise I
could see a virtual hand following my movements. With my digital hand
I’ve picked up a pen and tried to write down “14:35”. The moment I did
it, numbers on the paper changed into some scribbles. My “daughter”
sighed and asked me to try again. At that moment I felt the frustration
of the father from this story, I couldn’t communicate with people around
me. Any attempt that I’ve made was met with an obstacle. I could for
that brief moment experience what people with aphasia</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"> “Aphasia - Symptoms & Causes.” Mayo Clinic, 11 June 2022, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aphasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369518
	<br/><br /></span></span> <em>might be experiencing on a
daily basis.</em></p>
<p>Through realistic visuals, spatial audio, and interactive elements,
VR can create powerful emotional connections with characters and story
events, making the storytelling experience more impactful and memorable.
Compared to films, there is no director that tells the audience what
shot of the story to watch, when we put on VR goggles suddenly we are
the director and we control what angle we want to see. Having the power
over it may make his medium more appealing to the audience and thus make
them more engaged with the story presented. For those who have not
experienced what is presented in the immersive stories, VR simulations
can provide a glimpse into the reality of it. By immersing viewers in
the perspectives of people from different cultures, with illnesses, or
even war survivors, VR fosters empathy and understanding, influencing
the way their stories are received and interpreted by others. Viewers
may develop a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the story they
experience.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned before in this thesis how the audience engages with
the stories in interactive environments via entertainment. However,
there are stories told in those mediums that are far from entertaining
and yet they still draw in. What I mean by that is an example of a
virtual reality (VR) project done by Harun Farocki titled “Serious Games
III: Immersion” in 2009-2010. This particular project tells a moving
story of soldiers who have been sent to the war in Afghanistan and now
are suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Using VR
goggles patients are transported to the virtual recreation of the war
they’ve experienced and via exposure therapy they hope to get better.
Farocki presents footage of a role-playing exercise in which military
psychologists demonstrate how to use the PTSD program on their
colleagues, who describe traumatic wartime experiences. The audience of
this project is faced with traumatic stories of the war survivors and
looks at how those soldiers relive their experiences in VR goggles.</p>
<p>VR provides an immersive environment that can evoke strong emotional
responses from users by engaging most of the senses. War survivors
experiencing VR simulations of combat scenarios may feel as though they
are reliving traumatic events, leading to more vivid and detailed
storytelling. The heightened sense of presence in VR can make the
stories told by these individuals feel more impactful.</p>
<p>Moreover, while putting on the VR goggles one is cut out from the
onsite world, experiencing only this one thing at the time individually.
VR can create a safe and controlled space for war survivors to confront
and process their traumatic experiences. In this supportive environment,
individuals may feel more comfortable opening up and sharing their
stories. The sense of anonymity and detachment afforded by VR can also
reduce feelings of shame or embarrassment, allowing survivors to speak
more freely about their experiences.</p>
<p>Overall, the use of VR in therapy for war survivors not only
facilitates the treatment of PTSD but also influences the way their
stories are told and understood. By providing an immersive and safe
space for expression, fostering empathy and understanding, and enhancing
memory retrieval, VR plays a transformative role in shaping the
narratives of those who have lived through war.</p>
<p>Choosing VR as a medium for the storytelling can help the story
itself by making the audience more immersed in it. As said in the
previous paragraphs it can add to the storytelling by isolating the
audience to experience the story, influence many senses and give power
over experiencing the story as one wishes. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a
uniquely immersive experience, enabling users to inhabit and interact
with story environments in a deeply engaging manner, fostering a sense
of presence and agency that traditional media cannot replicate. Its
ability to transport users to alternate realities and allow for
firsthand exploration enhances empathy, immersion, and the potential for
impactful storytelling experiences.</p>

<h2 class="target conclusion" id ="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the exploration of storytelling in interactive
environments reveals a dynamic and multifaceted landscape where
narratives are crafted, experienced, and shared in novel ways. From
traditional mediums like oral storytelling, literature and film to
modern platforms such as video games and virtual reality, storytelling
continues to evolve, adapting to new technologies and engaging audiences
in immersive experiences. The beauty of storytelling lies in its ability
to transport audiences to different worlds, evoke powerful emotions, and
provoke thought and introspection.</p>
<p>In this thesis, I have delved into various forms of interactive
storytelling, examining their significance and impact on audience
engagement. From tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons
to video games like Life is Strange and The Stanley Parable, we have
witnessed how interactivity enhances the narrative experience, allowing
players to actively shape the story through their decisions and actions.
In these environments, storytelling becomes a collaborative endeavour,
with both creators and players contributing to the unfolding
narrative.</p>
<p>Moreover, the emergence of immersive technologies such as virtual
reality has opened up new possibilities for storytelling, allowing users
to step into virtual worlds and experience narratives in unprecedented
ways. Through realistic visuals, spatial audio, and interactive
elements, VR creates powerful emotional connections with characters and
story events, fostering empathy and understanding. Projects like
"Serious Games III: Immersion" by Harun Farocki demonstrate how VR can
be used not only for entertainment but also for therapeutic purposes,
facilitating the treatment of PTSD and shaping the narratives of war
survivors.</p>
<p>In this ever-evolving landscape of interactive storytelling, the role
of the storyteller remains crucial. Whether it's a Dungeon Master
guiding players through a D&amp;D campaign, a game developer crafting
branching narratives in a video game, or an artist creating immersive
experiences in virtual reality, storytellers have the power to captivate
audiences, provoke emotions, and spark imagination. By harnessing the
principles of game theory and storytelling, creators can create
compelling narratives that resonate with audiences on a deeper
level.</p>
<p>In conclusion, storytelling in interactive environments represents a
convergence of creativity, technology, and human experience, offering
endless opportunities for exploration and discovery. Whether it's
through a game, a virtual reality experience, or a collaborative
storytelling session, the power of storytelling transcends boundaries,
connecting people across cultures, languages, and backgrounds. As we
navigate this ever-changing landscape, let us continue to embrace the
magic of storytelling and harness its transformative potential for the
benefit of all.</p>
